Digital Lending Risk Analysis & Prediction

 Project Overview
This project analyzes digital lending data (Lending Club loans, ~396k records) to predict loan default risk.  
The goal is to help fintech companies assess borrower risk more accurately, reduce defaults, and make data-driven lending decisions.

 Objectives
Define loan default (`loan_status`) and create a binary target variable.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on loan features such as income, employment, and debt-to-income ratio.
Engineer features that capture borrower creditworthiness (e.g., loan-to-income ratio).
Build baseline (Logistic Regression) and advanced (LightGBM) models for default prediction.
Use SHAP explainability to interpret risk drivers.
Create a Streamlit dashboard for interactive loan risk scoring.

Tech Stack
